I used the "kddcup.data_10_percent_corrected" file rather than the full data set. For the "supervised" input, I edited that file with a couple wrong assessments and named it "kddcup.data_10_percent_wrong." Those files are too big to upload here.
Ideally at some point I can change it to accept commandline inputs rather than hardcoding the file names.
